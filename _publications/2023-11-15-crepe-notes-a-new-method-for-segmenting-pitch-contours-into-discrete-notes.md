Tracking the fundamental frequency (f0) of a monophonic instrumental performance is effectively a solved problem with several solutions achieving 99% accuracy. However, the related task of automatic music transcription requires a further processing step to segment an f0 contour into discrete notes. This sub-task of note segmentation is necessary to enable a range of applications including musicological analysis and symbolic music generation. Building on CREPE, a state-of-the-art monophonic pitch tracking solution based on a simple neural network, we propose a simple and effective method for post-processing CREPE's output to achieve monophonic note segmentation. The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets of monophonic instrumental music. Our approach also gives a 97% reduction in the total number of parameters used when compared with other deep learning based methods.
