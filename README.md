Hi ðŸ‘‹ - I'm a Music Informatics researcher working with AI and Music. My research so far mainly covers audio-to-MIDI transcription but I'm interested in lots of other MIR and audio topics as well.

I'm on most socials as @xavriley. Before my PhD I worked at FreeAgent, Heroku and various other places using Ruby. Nowdays I'm mostly dealing with Python, and when I have the chance, Elixir.
