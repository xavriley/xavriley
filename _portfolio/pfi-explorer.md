#### PFI Explorer

As part of the [Rewired State Accountability Hack 2014](http://hacks.rewiredstate.org/events/acchack14) I took part in the winning entry in the National Audit Office category. We built a tool to combine HMS Treasury data with several other sources to produce a browsable interface of the currently active PFI projects that the government is undertaking. The result was a proof of concept to illustrate ways in which the NAO might be able to publish results without resorting to the PDF reporting format.
