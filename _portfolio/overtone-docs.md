I took an interest in the Clojure project Overtone (which has the same lead developer as Sonic Pi) but found it hard to get started. I attempted to fork and run a version of the popular ClojureDocs site to work with the Overtone codebase. This worked but required some changes which remained in my fork. I'm including it here as an example of my experiments with Clojure. The front end site was written in Rails but the importer was a Clojure program. This has since been superseded by other Clojure documentation projects.
