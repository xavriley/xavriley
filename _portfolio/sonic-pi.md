#### Sonic Pi core team

I'm very lucky to be working on the Sonic Pi project which combines Ruby and SuperCollider to allow anybody to write programs to create good music. As well as working on the codebase I have written some short pieces and examples at [gist.github.com/xavriley](https://gist.github.com/xavriley)
