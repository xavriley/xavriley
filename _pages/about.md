This is my personal site. I'm recently completed my PhD in AI and Music at QMUL in London. Before that I've was a Ruby on Rails developer and a Support Engineering Manager at Heroku (2015-2019) where I was part of an incredible support team.

My background is in music - I've played guitar since I was 10 and double bass since I was 13 - and I've tried to combine this with programming as you can see on this site. I love jazz and swing music, especially guitar players from the 1920s-1960s and I lead a local big band. To develop my own playing I make a lot of [transcriptions](/transcriptions) - these take ages to do manually and I've looked at ways to improve automatic transcription as part of my PhD research.
